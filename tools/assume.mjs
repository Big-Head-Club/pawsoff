// The assumption ledger.
//
// Every game built on this template starts by writing down what it is assuming,
// because the expensive mistakes in this collection were never bugs — they were
// beliefs. "Active tomatoes is the difficulty dial." "The spec terminates."
// "Purge radius is a dial." Each one was held confidently, was never written
// down, and cost a day.
//
// So: assumptions are HYPOTHESES with an id and a status. Some of them this file
// can test for you and does, on every `npm test`. The rest you answer in prose,
// and the checker only insists that you answered.
//
// When one turns out to be wrong you run `assume break`, which flips it and
// opens a lesson stub — because a broken assumption IS the lesson, and that is
// the only moment the knowledge is cheap to capture. `assume promote` then
// carries lessons back up into the template's DESIGN-LESSONS.md so the next
// game starts from what this one learned.
//
//   node tools/assume.mjs check                 what can be verified, is
//   node tools/assume.mjs break <id> "why"      an assumption failed -> lesson stub
//   node tools/assume.mjs learn "..."           record a lesson that came from nowhere
//   node tools/assume.mjs promote [--write]     send lessons up to the template
//   node tools/assume.mjs init                  fresh ledger (new-game.mjs runs this)

  { id: "terminates", auto: true,
    q: "Does every run end?",
    why: "Detritus, as specified, could not terminate. Nothing in its rules rewarded advancing." },
  { id: "metric-moves", auto: true,
    q: "Does the leaderboard metric actually vary between runs?",
    why: "A metric that is the same for everybody is a leaderboard sorted by submission time wearing a hat." },
  { id: "strip-not-fingerprint", auto: true,
    q: "Can the share strip be reversed into the answer?",
    why: "If the number of distinct strips approaches the number of distinct puzzles, the strip is an identifier and the game dies in the group chat that liked it most." },
  { id: "rules-pure", auto: true,
    q: "Is the rules file free of the DOM, the clock and unseeded randomness?",
    why: "It is the anti-cheat, and it is only the anti-cheat while it is pure. One Date.now() and the server can no longer reproduce a run." },
  { id: "deterministic", auto: true,
    q: "Does the same seed produce the same run, every time?",
    why: "Everything downstream — verification, the daily itself, the archive — is built on this." },
  { id: "identity-set", auto: true,
    q: "Have you set key, title and epoch away from the template's defaults?",
    why: "Two games sharing a key hand out the same puzzle. An unset epoch means puzzle numbers that do not match the day you launched." },
  { id: "practice-not-spoiler", auto: true,
    q: "Does the practice-gate seed collide with any real day's puzzle?",
    why: "The first-run practice round handing somebody next Tuesday's puzzle is a slow leak nobody would think to look for." },
  { id: "one-handed", auto: false,
    q: "Can this be played one-handed on a phone, outdoors, while walking?",
    why: "That is how a link from a group chat is opened. If it needs a keyboard it is not a link game; daily-maze had to ship separate boards for mouse and touch." },
  { id: "day-boundary", auto: false,
    q: "Why did you pick this timezone for the day boundary, and who does it disadvantage?",
    why: "One global boundary means the chat always discusses one puzzle and someone can be spoiled. A per-player boundary means nobody is spoiled and the chat is incoherent. Three games here each picked differently, by accident." },
  { id: "first-thirty-seconds", auto: false,
    q: "What does a stranger who has never heard of this see in their first thirty seconds?",
    why: "They arrived from a link, mid-conversation, with no context and no patience." },
