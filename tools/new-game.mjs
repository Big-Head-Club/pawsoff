\`\`\`

- \`ASSUMPTIONS.md\` — what this game is assuming. \`npm test\` fails while any of it
  is unanswered. Answer it before writing code.
- \`LESSONS.md\` — what it turned out to be wrong about. Often empty, and that is
  fine.
- \`src/game/game.rules.mjs\` — the rules. Pure: no DOM, no clock, no
  \`Math.random\`. The server replays submitted runs with it.
- \`src/game/game.view.mjs\` — the screen.
- \`relay.config.mjs\` — name, day boundary, metric, share lines.
- \`docs/DESIGN-LESSONS.md\` — read it.

Production needs \`PUBLIC_ORIGIN\` (absolute, or the unfurl is wrong),
\`DAILY_SALT\` (or tomorrow is precomputable) and \`SAVE_PATH\` on a volume (or the
leaderboard dies with the container).

  1. answer ASSUMPTIONS.md          <- do this before you write any code
  2. write src/game/game.rules.mjs  (pure)
  3. write src/game/game.view.mjs   (the screen)
  4. edit relay.config.mjs          (metric, share lines)
  5. npm test && node server.js

Everything else — the link, the card, the day, the board, the streak, the
practice gate — already works. \`npm test\` will not pass until the assumptions
are written down; that is deliberate.`)
